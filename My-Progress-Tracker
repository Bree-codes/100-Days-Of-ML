# 100 Days of Machine Learning Challenge
Welcome to my 100-day journey to master machine learning! This repository serves as the central hub for all my work during the challenge.I'll be adding links to all the repositories that I will be working with for those 100 days.

## Week 1: Python Basics
Repository: https://github.com/Bree-codes/PythonFundamentals

This first week i've worked on:
-> Python variables and data types
-> Control statements and loops
-> Lists ,Dictionaries and Tuples
-> String manipulation and File Handling
-> Python Libraries(math,random,date&time and OS)

I pushed all my work here: https://github.com/Bree-codes/PythonFundamentals


## Week 2: Data Handling with NumPy and Pandas
Repository: https://github.com/Bree-codes/Data-Handling-With-NumPy-Pandas

Am in the second week now working on Data Handling with Numpy and Pandas.
I've learnt: 
-> Data Handling with Numpy 
-> Pandas DataFrames and series
-> Numpy and Pandas functions

I pushed all my work here: https://github.com/Bree-codes/Data-Handling-With-NumPy-Pandas

## Week 3: Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
Repository: https://github.com/Bree-codes/DataVisualization-Matplotlib-Seaborn

Welcome to week 3 of 100 days of ML.
Am working on Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn.So Lets get into it :)
-> I've learnt how to visualize data and also to customize our codes for more visually appealing diagrams.
-> I've learnt the various functions for both the libraries
-> I got to know of Streamlit am yet to explore it but am quite intrested in it to create apps for my data analysis
-> I worked with Kaggle for the week and I was able to get a certification after completing the Data Visualization course.
-> This is the link to Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/learn 
-> Kaggle provides free datasets that you can download and use for analysis.

I pushed all my work here: https://github.com/Bree-codes/DataVisualization-Matplotlib-Seaborn
See you in week 4 :)

## Week 4: Basic Statistics and Probability
Repository: https://github.com/Bree-codes/Statistics-and-Probability

-> This week is all about jogging my memory on some Maths concepts for ML.
-> The main topic is Statistics and Probability.

## Week 5: Introduction to Machine Learning
Repository: https://github.com/Bree-codes/Introduction-to-Machine-Learning

-> This week i've covered the fundamental concepts that introduce us to the world of Machine Learning.
-> Scikit-learn
-> Types of Machine Learning
-> ML Models 
-> Steps of Creating a Model

## Week 6: Machine Learning Algorithms
Repository: https://github.com/Bree-codes/MachineLearning-Algorithms

->I've covered these algorthims:
  . Linear Regression
  . Logistic Regression
  . Decision Trees
  . K Nearest Neighbours
  . Support Vector Machine
.Basically i've been working on Supervised Learning Algorithms.

## Week 7: Model Evaluation and Improvement
  Introduction to model evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
• Learn about confusion matrices.
• Explore cross-validation and its importance.
• Learn about overfitting, underfitting, and the bias-variance tradeoff.
• Techniques for improving models: feature scaling, regularization
